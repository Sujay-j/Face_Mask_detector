In the new world of Covid, multidisciplinary efforts have been sorted out to slow the spread of the pandemic. The AI people group has likewise been an aspect of these undertakings. Specifically, advancements for checking social Distancing or recognizing face mask have stood out as truly newsworthy.
With an end goal to paint a more complete picture, we chose to show the imaginative cycle behind an answer for an apparently straightforward use case in  Computer ision: 

1. Identify individuals that go through a security-like camera. 
2. Distinguish face mask usage.

I have implemented Transfer Learning using MobileNetV2 architecture followed by Flatten layer and fully connected Dense layer with relu activation and the last dense layer has 2 nodes to predict wether the mask is on or off with softmax activation
